# loan-default-prediction
- We have loan defaults dataset from a bank and we try to biuld a loan default classifier using deep learning methods.
- This portfolio project is a part of course module: Deep Learning at FH Kiel, Kiel, Germany.
- Goals of the project:
    - Do exploratory data analysis on the data
    - Preprocess the data to make it ready for training machine learning models
    - Create baseline models, it see how good the data is for the prediction
    - Try different architectures of deep neural networks to train the data and improve the performance
    - Evaluate all predictive models, give a verdict if the poc works and suggest further steps beyond poc.
